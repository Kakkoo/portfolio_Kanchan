    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAssisted 5th graders' Math class in an easy and fun way with real life examples. I felt
      valuable when I saw they were
      eagerly waiting for me in thier next class.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(October-2019 to April-2019, Fernwood Elementary School, Bothell - Washington.)</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I was an Art Docent in Frank Love Elementary School, there I got chance to explore my
      creativity. I have used PowerPoint
      to teach kids using pictures, colors, and story books. I felt rewarded when the little kids created artwork, with
      their
      own hands.</p>
